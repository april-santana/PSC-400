		<h1> Start of Covid </h1>
			<p> I feel like at the beginning of the pandemic, my fear stemmed from the unknown. With information changing constantly, my senior year being canceled, and the number of cases rising every day, I did not leave my house until May of 2020. The pandemic had great social disruption. Everyone went from being social, being used to close contact and seeing each other every day, to now being stuck at home with the fear of contracting a deadly virus upon breathing on each other. The immediate jolting from normal life had a negative impact on society’s collective mental health. There was an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/mental-health-covid-19/art-20482731" target="_blank">increase </a> in adults who, during the pandemic, reported elevated levels of stress, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Being cooped up for months with no end in sight could take a significant toll on one’s mental health. If it wasn’t for our family Wii –which we’ve had since like 2010 and didn't use until we were forced inside for months– I don’t think we would have finished lockdown with any level of sanity. I remember I would get up early for my zooms and finish “school” by 12:30. It was an endless loop - one that was made almost impossible because I had two younger siblings who were also trying to do their virtual school. I was sick of my room, sick of my living room, I was tired of being home and being confined to the four walls of my house. </p>

					<h2> Vaccinated- Now what?</h2>
					<p >I remember earlier this year when vaccines were first being introduced to the public and the feeling of relief that I felt on April 5,2021 when I secured my vaccination appointment. Up until this point, people in my demographic were not allowed to get vaccinated. I remember living in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.577684/full" targer="_blank">fear of catching COVID</a> - especially since the University was being a lot more relaxed on the guidelines and the country seemed to be opening up again. I’m not scared of getting covid because of what it can do to me — I’m 20 years old and would most likely have minimal to no symptoms — but of what it could do to my older family members. </p>
					<p> Getting my first dose of the vaccine - though it may have caused a few uncomfortable symptoms- was immensely satisfying. Despite the fact that I had a five hour sociology exam right after my shot, I felt like an immense weight was lifted off of my shoulders. Though the Delta variant was making its way through the country, I felt like I could now breathe a little lighter. </p>

				<p> Later that summer, as things began opening up, I felt that we were a step closer to getting to a somewhat sense of normalcy. I started my sophomore year in college and as I finished unloading the last of my things in August, I thought that this would be the semester where I’d get a sense of the real college experience. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="last">
				<p> On August 28, 2021, the university placed us on level red and never waivered. This involved masking both outside – which no one did – and inside. The semester was stressful for different reasons than my first two semesters at Syracuse. I now had to reteach myself how to be a student. With professors being less understanding of the pressure and stress that comes with living in a pandemic, I had to adjust to all in-person classes with no breaks. This semester I had four back-to-back classes on Mondays and Wednesdays. I no longer have an attention span and found it very difficult to sit in a class for an hour and 20 minutes without getting distracted. </p>

  				<div class="card-body"><p>For my Stats class, I found that I could not focus on what my professor was saying at all. I had never been in a big lecture hall where a professor literally had to wear a microphone to be heard – which was pointless because if you sat in the back (which I did because I had a class across campus 10 minutes prior) you could not hear anything. To compensate, I started listening to music. I couldn’t hear anyway, might as well not stress and enjoy the boring class.</p>

		<h2> Omicron and the New Normal</h2>
			<div class="container-fluid">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
							<p> The new variant is bringing back some of my initial fears. Even though I already got my <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-provide-update-omicron-variant" target="_blank">Pfizer </a> booster two weeks ago, I can’t shake the feeling that we are heading in the online-close-everything-down-and-go-into-lockdown direction. Though <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html" target="_blank"> Omicron </a> may not be as dangerous as Delta, the fact that it’s more infectious kinda scares me. </p>

							<p> I don’t know what a post covid world will look like but I don’t think we will revert back to how things were pre covid. Too much has happened, too many people have died, the societal disruption has been too significant to return to how things were. I’m starting to forget what it feels like to go out without having to do my pre-exit checklist: phone, keys, wallet, mask.  </p>

							<p>I feel a little bit cheated. I’ve worn my mask. I stayed inside during lockdown. I didn’t go out. I followed all the guidelines. I got my vaccine. I got my booster. And somehow I still feel like I’m losing my young adult years to the pandemic. I’ll be 21 in March. I was 18 when Covid first started. I just don’t know when this is going to end. Will I go through my four years of college wearing a mask, never seeing anyone’s face? Because I just about finished my 3rd semester and I know about 20 people in college: a school with thousands of people. </p>

				<div class="last">
					<p> I really hope that the pandemic is reaching its end. This has been my stance the entire semester, but I genuinely believe that we should mandate vaccines. I think that is the only way to get numbers down and protect people against future variants. Anti-vaxxers, with their anti-vaccine propaganda, are overwhelming hospitals and are contributing to our high numbers. Yes, Omicron may be more contagious, but numbers were already high among the unvaccinated prior to a new variant. </p>
